# Data-Mining-Data-pre-processing-classification-and-clustering
This project involves building a data mining model using decision trees and K-means clustering.

### Part 1: Classification

- Objective: Predict wine quality based on physicochemical tests using decision trees and neural networks.
- Data Processing: Handle missing values in the dataset and preprocess the data by replacing missing attributes with mean values.
- Model Development: Build decision tree and neural network classifiers, perform 10-fold cross-validation, and evaluate model performance using confusion matrix, accuracy, and AUC.
- Discussion: Compare decision tree vs. neural network performance and analyze the impact of hyperparameters.
### Part 2: Clustering

- Objective: Apply K-means clustering (K=2) to classify signal data from a phased array of high-frequency antennas.
- Clustering: Use scikit-learn to perform clustering and analyze the results.
- Analysis: Examine the clustering results and relate them to class labels.
